  ## Description:
  - This project is a randomly generated README.md file.
  - The motivation for this project was to create a README.md file through the terminal using the npm Inquirer Package.
  - This project has been built with JavaScript, NodeJS and the npm Inquirer Package.
  - There were some challenges initially with writing the functions for this project.
  - After the functions were written, a error message was received in the terminal because the package-lock.json file had not been added to the start code.
  - As well, a console.log was causing errors in the terminal only going through some user inputs questions/statements, hence the README was not being generated. 

  ## Installation:
  - Install NodeJS
  - The user can check if they already have Node JS by going to their terminal and running the command node -v
  - If the user does not have NodeJS already installed they can go to nodejs.org and follow the instruction provided

  
  ## Usage:
  - To use this project the user must open their intergrated terminal in their source code editor, or in this case, Visual Studio Code
