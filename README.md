  ## Description
  - This project is a randomly generated README.md file.
  - The motivation for this project was to create a README.md file through the command-line.
  - This project has been built with JavaScript, NodeJS and the npm Inquirer Package.
  - There were some challenges initially with writing the functions for this project.
  - After the functions were written, a error message was received in the terminal because the package-lock.json file had not been added to the starter code.
  - As well, a console.log in the index.js file was causing errors in the terminal only going through some user questions and statements, hence the README was not being generated. Once this was removed the README file generated.

  ## Installation
  - Install NodeJS
  - The user can check if they already have Node JS by going to their terminal and running the command node -v
  - If the user does not have NodeJS already installed they can go to nodejs.org and follow the instruction provided
  - The user must have a source code editor, for example Visual Studio Code, and open the intergrated terminal. 
  
  ## Usage
  - To use this project the user must open their intergrated terminal in their source code editor, which in this case is Visual Studio Code, and begin by typing node index.js
  - The user will then go through the prompted questions and statements
